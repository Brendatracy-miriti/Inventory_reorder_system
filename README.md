## Dynamic Inventory Reordering System: Predicting Tomorrow's Shelf Needs

### ðŸ’¡ The Problem: The Inventory Guessing Game

Inventory management is often a game of expensive guesswork, leading to two major issues:
1.  **Stockouts:** Not having product on the shelf when a customer wants it, resulting in lost sales and frustrated customers.
2.  **Overstocking:** Holding too much product, which ties up cash (holding costs) and risks spoilage or obsolescence.

The challenge is that demand is never steady; it's affected by holidays, competitor prices, weather, and promotions.

### Project Objectives

The goal is to eliminate manual guesswork and build an intelligent, data-driven system that achieves two things:
1.  **Maximize Customer Satisfaction:** Ensure high-demand products are always in stock.
2.  **Minimize Business Costs:** Reduce excess inventory holding costs.

### Methodology and Core Engine

This project employs a robust machine learning approach to move from reactive ordering to proactive optimization.

**Model Selection:** We utilize a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict the future demand for every unique item (SKU) at every store. Random Forest is highly effective because it naturally handles the non-linear impact of factors like discounts, seasonality, and competitor pricing on sales.

### Key System Functionalities

| Phase | Functionality | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Preparation and Feature Engineering** | Feature Creation & Encoding | Transforms raw data (date, price, external factors) into over 20 predictive features, including lagged sales and the critical **demand variability ($\sigma$)**. |
| **Forecasting Engine** | Demand Prediction (Random Forest) | Predicts the exact number of units an SKU will sell during the supplier's lead time. |
| **Optimization Module** | Dynamic ROP/ROQ Calculation | Uses the forecast and $\sigma$ to dynamically calculate the **Reorder Point (ROP)** and **Reorder Quantity (ROQ)**, minimizing stockout risk for a target service level. |
| **Simulation** | Cost-Benefit Analysis | Quantifies the financial impact by simulating inventory cycles and comparing the savings generated by the new dynamic policy versus the old static policy. |

### Conclusion and UI Vision

The **Dynamic Inventory Reordering System** acts as a data science co-pilot for inventory managers.

The final **Web Dashboard** will provide a single, easy-to-read view:
* **The Go/No-Go Signal:** Clear visual alerts (Red/Yellow/Green) showing which SKUs have dropped below their **dynamic ROP** and require an immediate order.
* **Actionable Advice:** The system tells the manager not just *when* to order, but precisely *how much* to order ($\text{ROQ}$), backed by the predicted cost savings.

This tool turns complex time-series analysis into simple, profitable business decisions, ensuring happy customers and a healthier bottom line.
