    "This capstone project implements a data-driven system to optimize inventory management. It replaces static, rule-based reordering policies with a dynamic, predictive engine that forecasts future demand and calculates the optimal Reorder Point (ROP) and Reorder Quantity (ROQ) for each product.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to minimize total inventory costs by balancing the reduction of costly stockouts (lost sales) against the minimization of expensive holding costs (storage, capital tied up)."
